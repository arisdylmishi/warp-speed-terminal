Warp Speed Terminal: The Ultimate Stock Market Intelligence System
Warp Speed Terminal is a professional analysis platform that synthesizes Technical Analysis, Fundamental Data, and Artificial Intelligence. It is designed to transform chaotic market data into clear, actionable signals, offering features typically found only in institutional-grade terminals.
Detailed Features:
1. Central Control Panel (Smart Dashboard)
The Investor's Headquarters.
• Macro Climate Bar: Live monitoring of the global market (VIX/Fear Index, 10-Year Bonds, Bitcoin, Oil) for an immediate grasp of market sentiment.
• Smart Watchlist & Memory: The user inputs tickers (e.g., AAPL, NVDA), and the system automatically saves them. Upon the next launch, the portfolio is pre-loaded.
• The Evaluation Algorithm:
• Verdict: A clear command signal (STRONG BUY, BUY, HOLD, SELL).
• Sniper Score (/100): A quantitative scoring of the opportunity based on multiple factors.
• Bubble Alert: Detection of overvalued stocks (bubbles).
• RVOL & RSI: Detection of unusual volume (institutional interest) and oversold levels.
2. Deep Analysis (Deep Dive View)
Double-clicking opens a full "X-ray" tab for the stock:
• Analysis & AI Tab: Justification of the Score using specific tags (e.g., "Volatility Squeeze"). The NLP engine "reads" the news, analyzes sentiment (Bullish/Bearish), and provides links to sources.
• Fundamentals Tab (Enriched): A complete check of the business's financial health and efficiency. It includes valuation metrics (P/E, PEG Ratio, Market Cap) and extends to critical quality indicators:
• Return on Equity (ROE): To check management efficiency.
• Debt-to-Equity: To assess debt burden.
• Free Cash Flow (FCF): The "truth" regarding liquidity, beyond accounting profits.
• Profit Margins: Indication of a competitive advantage (Economic Moat).
• Wall Street: Comparison with analyst forecasts and price targets.
• Risk Tab: Volatility analysis (Beta), bets on decline (Short Float), and revelation of major institutional holders (Skin in the Game).
3. Advanced Charting & "The Oracle"
Three synchronized charts with selectable timeframes (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, MAX):
• Price Chart with Benchmarking:
• Oracle Projection: The algorithm scans historical data, identifies similar past patterns, and projects a forecast line (Ghost) for the future.
• SPY Overlay: Compares the stock's performance directly against the S&P 500 index (to see if you are beating the market).
• Technical Tools: Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Levels, and Support/Resistance levels.
• MACD: Indicates Momentum and trend reversals.
• Volume: Color-coded volume for analyzing buyer/seller pressure.
4. Management & Export Tools
• Correlation Matrix: Creation of a Heatmap to check correlations between portfolio stocks (Risk Management).
• Data Export: Instant export of all data and scores to Excel/CSV files for archiving.
